I am a seasoned Senior Software Engineer with 8+ years of experience designing and developing scalable, secure, and maintainable systems across retail, travel, and finance industries. Recognized for building modern Java-based microservices with Spring Boot and leading backend modernization efforts, I bring a structured, clean-architecture mindset to every project.

Throughout my career, I’ve contributed to high-demand enterprise platforms using Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Hexagonal Architecture, and event-driven systems powered by Kafka and RabbitMQ. Whether in a permanent role or freelance capacity, I consistently deliver outcomes: systems that scale, codebases teams can work with, and architectures that support long-term growth.

Professional focal points include microservices architecture, secure APIs, and modern deployments on AWS using Docker and Kubernetes, as well as legacy system refactoring. I thrive in Agile environments, mentor junior engineers, and value technical leadership grounded in real engineering.

Currently, I’m engaged with enterprise clients across Europe and open to freelance and contract collaborations. My passion lies in building scalable systems that deliver clear business value, backed by clean code, thoughtful design, and cross-functional communication.

Colleagues describe me as a pragmatic, architecture-minded engineer who balances delivery speed with long-term system health.

I am pursuing new opportunities and can be reached through this profile.
